CrowBox Shape Files
===================

The SVG shape files here are intended to be used with a laser cutting provider like [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com) or to be laser cut at a local maker shop or similar. They're designed to be cut on sheets of 790mm x 384mm (31.1” x 15.1”) acrylic with a thickness of 3mm, and .5mm styrene.

Once you have the housing parts, check out our YouTube Channel for step-by-step assembly videos.

## Ponoku Specific Instructions

You should only need to upload three files total. The transparent acrylic shapes comes in a single or double layout. You can use the double layout to order two sheets of color acrylic and a single sheet of transparent acrylic to build two boxes.

When you select the designs and add them to your cart, you're welcome to select whichever color acrylic you'd like. Some of the matte finishes are nice, and it's important to understand and consider that color may play a role in the success of your CrowBox deployment, as crows (and other birds) have unique color vision.

Note that Ponoko shipping charges make up a big chunk of the final cost of a single set of parts - it's much more price-effective if you and a friend order your sets of parts together. Huge thanks to Danita Craft for pulling these together; see [this thread](https://groups.google.com/g/crowboxkit/c/9xb9-OHnaKQ/m/a6WmhurxAQAJ?pli=1) for more info.

**Disclaimer:** _We have bought several sets of CrowBox parts from Ponoko in order to verify their quality and accuracy. We have had good customer service experiences with them, as well. For these reasons, we're happy to recommend Ponoko as a place for you to buy your parts. Ponoko charges fees for materials, manufacturing services, and shipping but we have no financial interest or affiliation with them. We receive no money when parts are bought at Ponoko - we're just making a service recommendation._

## Source File

The source `.afdesign` file is provided to make refinements or adjustments of your own easier. The source file has been generated using [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer), which is a great application and available for a 7 day trial. The trial may be long enough for you to make the desired changes and export new SVG files. The provided SVG files are optimized to reduce multiple passes on laser cutting.

When you export SVGs it's recommended to run them through [ImageOptim](https://imageoptim.com/mac), which helps clean up a lot of things, especially some pesky width/height attributes that can confuse Ponoko or other laser cutters.
